He’s experienced invasive and debilitating skin rashes since childhood and was diagnosed severely obese and pre-diabetic. Since then, he’s found a cure through diet and nutrition.Thane graduated Summa Cum Laude from Purdue University, specializing in Nutrition and Holistic Medicine. He is now pursuing his Ph.D. in Holistic Natural Health, Healing, and Nutrition at the University of Natural Health.Cynthia is a craniofacial disability activist and graduate student finishing a second Master’s degree in Public Health at Purdue University while serving her internship at Patients Rising. She has overcome many chronic health conditions caused by Treacher Collins Syndrome, a genetic birth defect that affects the bones, muscles, and soft tissues of the face and skull. To date, she’s undergone 16+ reconstructive plastic surgeries.As the Murphys suffered a myriad of progressively worsening symptoms, they were led into the realm of veganism. They quickly realized that cases of cancer and medical illness are on the rise globally. Eating organically nutritious foods is challenging due to the scarcity of health resources and money.Assuaged was founded on the concept of the blue zones movement and in the region of Loma Linda, California – one of only five geographical areas in the world and the only one in the United States. Research studies and several news reports have established that residents in these blue zones maintain supreme health and live past the age of one hundred.The Murphys are passionately seeking to bridge the gap between healthcare and self-care to meet the needs of healthy living as a method for longevity. They are going beyond charity and unifying people through love and compassion.Assuaged’s motto is ‘Be Your Healthiest and Live Longer’.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[25, 31, "TYPEOFWORK"], [32, 51, "ROLE"], [56, 64, "COMPANYNAME"], [95, 118, "ORG"], [76, 86, "SOCIALCONTEXT"], [87, 94, "SOCIALCONTEXT"], [127, 158, "SOCIALCONTEXT"], [291, 311, "ORG"], [312, 320, "COMPANYNAME"], [368, 372, "ORG"], [416, 439, "SOCIALCONTEXT"], [709, 726, "ROLE"], [728, 744, "ROLE"], [746, 756, "ROLE"], [758, 778, "ROLE"], [780, 813, "ROLE"], [819, 829, "ROLE"], [874, 887, "BENEFIT"], [889, 904, "BENEFIT"], [910, 920, "TYPEOFWORK"], [1064, 1080, "BENEFIT"], [1129, 1145, "COMPANYNAME"], [1230, 1233, "CITY"], [1256, 1263, "CITY"], [1394, 1402, "ROLE"], [1456, 1472, "DOMAIN"], [1618, 1628, "ROLE"], [1630, 1638, "ROLE"], [1640, 1647, "ROLE"], [1649, 1671, "ROLE"], [1696, 1702, "ROLE"], [1824, 1847, "SOCIALCONTEXT"], [1888, 1896, "TECHNOLOGY"], [1898, 1906, "TECHNOLOGY"], [1915, 1939, "TECHNOLOGY"], [1952, 1960, "COMPANYNAME"], [2197, 2208, "ORG"], [2300, 2308, "COMPANYNAME"], [2397, 2407, "ROLE"], [2505, 2520, "TECHNOLOGY"], [2525, 2532, "TECHNOLOGY"], [2547, 2566, "ROLE"], [2568, 2578, "COMPANYNAME"], [2599, 2614, "ROLE"], [2623, 2632, "PRODUCT"], [2651, 2656, "PRODUCT"], [2682, 2687, "COMPANYNAME"], [2692, 2700, "COMPANYNAME"], [2701, 2708, "TECHNOLOGY"], [2710, 2713, "TECHNOLOGY"], [2847, 2861, "ROLE"], [2965, 2980, "ACTIVITY"], [3263, 3275, "ROLE"], [3522, 3540, "DOMAIN"], [3788, 3807, "ROLE"], [3812, 3828, "ROLE"], [3981, 3987, "DOMAIN"], [4296, 4304, "DOMAIN"], [4469, 4475, "DOMAIN"], [4496, 4504, "COMPANYNAME"], [4592, 4602, "LOCATION"], [4580, 4590, "CITY"], [4678, 4691, "COUNTRY"], [4757, 4766, "ROLE"], [4911, 4921, "DOMAIN"], [4926, 4935, "DOMAIN"], [4957, 4971, "DOMAIN"], [4988, 4997, "DOMAIN"], [5021, 5028, "DOMAIN"], [5077, 5086, "COMPANYNAME"], [3042, 3049, "PERSONNAME"], [3243, 3248, "PERSONNAME"], [3762, 3769, "PERSONNAME"], [4201, 4208, "PERSONNAME"], [1082, 1090, "COMPANYNAME"], [1110, 1123, "ROLE"]]}

He’s experienced invasive and debilitating skin rashes since childhood and was diagnosed severely obese and pre-diabetic. Since then, he’s found a cure through diet and nutrition.Thane graduated Summa Cum Laude from Purdue University, specializing in Nutrition and Holistic Medicine. He is now pursuing his Ph.D. in Holistic Natural Health, Healing, and Nutrition at the University of Natural Health.Cynthia is a craniofacial disability activist and graduate student finishing a second Master’s degree in Public Health at Purdue University while serving her internship at Patients Rising. She has overcome many chronic health conditions caused by Treacher Collins Syndrome, a genetic birth defect that affects the bones, muscles, and soft tissues of the face and skull. To date, she’s undergone 16+ reconstructive plastic surgeries.As the Murphys suffered a myriad of progressively worsening symptoms, they were led into the realm of veganism. They quickly realized that cases of cancer and medical illness are on the rise globally. Eating organically nutritious foods is challenging due to the scarcity of health resources and money.Assuaged was founded on the concept of the blue zones movement and in the region of Loma Linda, California – one of only five geographical areas in the world and the only one in the United States. Research studies and several news reports have established that residents in these blue zones maintain supreme health and live past the age of one hundred.The Murphys are passionately seeking to bridge the gap between healthcare and self-care to meet the needs of healthy living as a method for longevity. They are going beyond charity and unifying people through love and compassion.Assuaged’s motto is ‘Be Your Healthiest and Live Longer’.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[25, 32, "TYPEOFWORK"], [32, 43, "TYPEOFWORK"], [56, 64, "COMPANYNAME"], [127, 135, "ORG"], [136, 158, "ORG"], [291, 311, "DOMAIN"], [76, 118, "ORG"], [312, 320, "COMPANYNAME"], [648, 666, "REQUIREMENT"], [1116, 1124, "COMPANYNAME"], [1349, 1359, "SOFTSKILL"], [1626, 1644, "ACTIVITY"], [1652, 1662, "ROLE"], [1664, 1672, "ROLE"], [1674, 1681, "ROLE"], [1683, 1705, "ROLE"], [1730, 1736, "JOB ROLE"], [1858, 1881, "ORG"], [1986, 1994, "COMPANYNAME"], [2334, 2342, "COMPANYNAME"], [2473, 2495, "URL"], [908, 921, "BENEFIT"], [923, 938, "BENEFIT"], [944, 978, "BENEFIT"], [1083, 1114, "BENEFIT"]]}

This will include general VA tasks / projects like: 1. Listen to a screencast and turn it into a project plan / timeline 2. Make a list of linkedin groups related to XYZ topic 3. Find 3 high quality providers that offer XYZ services As well as marketing-focused support to help get more demo calls booked to discuss our company's services. If you don't have significant marketing experience, that's not a deal-breaker so long as you are eager to dive in, learn, execute, with great followthrough and reliability (so that I know if we invest in training you that will be put to use!) The marketing side of this role includes doing things like: 1. Lead generation  2. Run our cold email outreach campaigns  3. Run our Linkedin outreach campaigns 4. Book demo calls with prospective clients 5. Review weekly marketing reports / KPIs, suggest opportunities to optimize our campaigns, and help troubleshoot issues with marketing campaigns We have quite a bit of documentation, various lead generation and scraping accounts you will be able to use, and plenty of templates you can use in your campaigns. Characteristics that are important to us (for everyone we work with): - Clear communication - Problem-solving skills - Happy to help other team members - Are insanely dependable. There is a lot more to this position than existing skills. Dependability and responsiveness is more important to us than anything. On a scale of 1 to 10, we’d take a dependable person with a good attitude who is a 7 in terms of skills over an unresponsive person with a bad attitude who is a 10 any day. - Are very organized and never miss deadlines or important details. - Experience working in a self-autonomous way - we set outcomes for your role, and then check in with you, rather than constantly breathing down your neck If you are the type to not get the job done, make excuses, blame others, and get stuck with the most minor of obstacles, then you would not be a good fit. Location Remote, US timezones preferred. The experience of working with us: “Working with MYE has been a great experience. Not only do I get to work from home and on my own time–which has also taught me a lot of self-motivation and time management–but I’ve also learned what it’s like to start your own business, and how to best go about it. Grant’s also super kind, flexible, and he helps/teaches you as much as possible so that you get as much out of the experience as possible.” – Digne Who We Are Monetize Your Expertise (aka MYE) is a course production company - we create online courses and training for people and companies by doing all of the heavy lifting for them. Rather than running in circles for 6-12 months or more, trying to figure out how to build an online course, we do it for them. It only ends up taking a few hours of their time, and the result is world-class! We do all the work outlining their course, incorporating any other materials they might have, creating slides, worksheets, quizzes and more, editing the videos into a finished course, setting it all up onto a learning management system (LMS) and marketing the course to generate revenue for them. The eLearning industry is on track to become a $325 billion dollar industry over the coming years, with more and more business and organizations trying to incorporate this type of training into what they offer their customers or their team. MYE is the #1 company that offers a turnkey solution for companies to do this. What We Offer 1. WORK WITH A FAST-GROWING BUSINESS This position is a great opportunity to get the “behind the scenes” look inside a fast-growing business (course production company) with a great team. 2. WORK AUTONOMOUSLY If you can deliver on expectations, you will have ample opportunity to work on your own terms (as long as you continuously deliver results) 3. MASSIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITY Plenty of training available. If you’re interested in getting your hands into other parts of the business, we're happy to help you develop new skills. In fact, we have access to an entire massive library of courses from past projects that you can learn from (>$100,000 worth of high-quality training / courses that you will get access to as part of your position with us). 4. ROOM FOR GROWTH For a qualified individual, there is room for growth in the company. If your primary focus is getting this position just to make money, then this probably isn’t a great fit (there are certainly faster and easier ways to make a quick buck - it's more about happiness, impact and doing something great). However, if you are interested in learning a ton, doing great work, working with super cool people and serving extremely interesting and varied clients (while also being compensated), then this is for you. Our Culture We are a team of people who all deeply care about doing good work, helping each other, and helping our clients. The work style of the team is pretty independent - we make sure everyone has what they need to do a great job and then everyone goes off and does deep work. MYE doesn't try to grow as fast as possible, or make as much money as possible, or slave-drive employees. We value growth and learning and a well-rounded life. You can work in the way that is best for you, as long as you produce amazing results for our clients. The most important thing - this isn't just a job. We are looking for people who want to become part of the \"team\" for our company. This means that we don't want someone to just clock in and clock out, and do the bare minimum just to get paid. We need you to actually care about what we do as a company, want to help us grow and improve. Basically, if you just want to show up, get the work done, and go home, this is not for you. If you will be excited to do the work, bringing with you tons of ideas for how the company can grow and do better... helping us strive for continuous improvements for our team and our clients... always learning and improving individually as well as support other team members in doing the same. If you're excited to think about getting involved in the eLearning industry, and seeing this opportunity as an investment in growing something greater than yourself, then you are our type of person.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

If the client program does not currently allow VoIP, agents will not be servicing on AVG.Please be sure to review the opportunity announcement in detail to see if AVG is required on the client program you select.BenefitsWork from homeDetermine your own work scheduleScalable income opportunity", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

{"id": 527, "text": "Looking to add some additional team members to help with miscellaneous work that needs to be done in our business, including marketing support.  This will include general VA tasks / projects like: 1. Listen to a screencast and turn it into a project plan / timeline 2. Make a list of linkedin groups related to XYZ topic 3. Find 3 high quality providers that offer XYZ services As well as marketing-focused support to help get more demo calls booked to discuss our company's services. If you don't have significant marketing experience, that's not a deal-breaker so long as you are eager to dive in, learn, execute, with great followthrough and reliability (so that I know if we invest in training you that will be put to use!) The marketing side of this role includes doing things like: 1. Lead generation  2. Run our cold email outreach campaigns  3. Run our Linkedin outreach campaigns 4. Book demo calls with prospective clients 5. Review weekly marketing reports / KPIs, suggest opportunities to optimize our campaigns, and help troubleshoot issues with marketing campaigns We have quite a bit of documentation, various lead generation and scraping accounts you will be able to use, and plenty of templates you can use in your campaigns. Characteristics that are important to us (for everyone we work with): - Clear communication - Problem-solving skills - Happy to help other team members - Are insanely dependable. There is a lot more to this position than existing skills. Dependability and responsiveness is more important to us than anything. On a scale of 1 to 10, we’d take a dependable person with a good attitude who is a 7 in terms of skills over an unresponsive person with a bad attitude who is a 10 any day. - Are very organized and never miss deadlines or important details. - Experience working in a self-autonomous way - we set outcomes for your role, and then check in with you, rather than constantly breathing down your neck If you are the type to not get the job done, make excuses, blame others, and get stuck with the most minor of obstacles, then you would not be a good fit. Location Remote, US timezones preferred. The experience of working with us: “Working with MYE has been a great experience. Not only do I get to work from home and on my own time–which has also taught me a lot of self-motivation and time management–but I’ve also learned what it’s like to start your own business, and how to best go about it. Grant’s also super kind, flexible, and he helps/teaches you as much as possible so that you get as much out of the experience as possible.” – Digne Who We Are Monetize Your Expertise (aka MYE) is a course production company - we create online courses and training for people and companies by doing all of the heavy lifting for them. Rather than running in circles for 6-12 months or more, trying to figure out how to build an online course, we do it for them. It only ends up taking a few hours of their time, and the result is world-class! We do all the work outlining their course, incorporating any other materials they might have, creating slides, worksheets, quizzes and more, editing the videos into a finished course, setting it all up onto a learning management system (LMS) and marketing the course to generate revenue for them. The eLearning industry is on track to become a $325 billion dollar industry over the coming years, with more and more business and organizations trying to incorporate this type of training into what they offer their customers or their team. MYE is the #1 company that offers a turnkey solution for companies to do this. What We Offer 1. WORK WITH A FAST-GROWING BUSINESS This position is a great opportunity to get the “behind the scenes” look inside a fast-growing business (course production company) with a great team. 2. WORK AUTONOMOUSLY If you can deliver on expectations, you will have ample opportunity to work on your own terms (as long as you continuously deliver results) 3. MASSIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITY Plenty of training available. If you’re interested in getting your hands into other parts of the business, we're happy to help you develop new skills. In fact, we have access to an entire massive library of courses from past projects that you can learn from (>$100,000 worth of high-quality training / courses that you will get access to as part of your position with us). 4. ROOM FOR GROWTH For a qualified individual, there is room for growth in the company. If your primary focus is getting this position just to make money, then this probably isn’t a great fit (there are certainly faster and easier ways to make a quick buck - it's more about happiness, impact and doing something great). However, if you are interested in learning a ton, doing great work, working with super cool people and serving extremely interesting and varied clients (while also being compensated), then this is for you. Our Culture We are a team of people who all deeply care about doing good work, helping each other, and helping our clients. The work style of the team is pretty independent - we make sure everyone has what they need to do a great job and then everyone goes off and does deep work. MYE doesn't try to grow as fast as possible, or make as much money as possible, or slave-drive employees. We value growth and learning and a well-rounded life. You can work in the way that is best for you, as long as you produce amazing results for our clients. The most important thing - this isn't just a job. We are looking for people who want to become part of the \"team\" for our company. This means that we don't want someone to just clock in and clock out, and do the bare minimum just to get paid. We need you to actually care about what we do as a company, want to help us grow and improve. Basically, if you just want to show up, get the work done, and go home, this is not for you. If you will be excited to do the work, bringing with you tons of ideas for how the company can grow and do better... helping us strive for continuous improvements for our team and our clients... always learning and improving individually as well as support other team members in doing the same. If you're excited to think about getting involved in the eLearning industry, and seeing this opportunity as an investment in growing something greater than yourself, then you are our type of person.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

If the client program does not currently allow VoIP, agents will not be servicing on AVG.Please be sure to review the opportunity announcement in detail to see if AVG is required on the client program you select.BenefitsWork from homeDetermine your own work scheduleScalable income opportunity", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
